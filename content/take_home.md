# Take Home Messages

Today, we learned how to use operators in R, how to work through errors in R, how to customize the appearance of RStudio, and how to cite R packages.

If you want more practice with R, you can try some of the exercises at the end of [Beginner R Part 1](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/Beginner_R_Part1/content/summary.html) or see the next section where you can try to fix errors in pre-made code.

To keep building your R knowledge, you can take some more [R workshops we will offer soon.](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/workshops/)

If you need more personalized help, you can [book a consult](https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/appointments/research_commons).
